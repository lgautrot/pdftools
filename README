PDFTools is a set of Perl scripts written for the purpose of
low-level user actions.

Currently, several commands are available:

    pdfextract: extract some pages from a PDF

      pdfmerge: merge several PDF files

  pdfpagecount: return the number of pages inside of a PDF file

      pdfsplit: split one or more PDF files to a bunch of one-page PDF
                files

The documentation is available as POD inside of each script.

Prerequisites: PDF::API2, Pod::Usage
